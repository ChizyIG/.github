## What We Do
We identify and invest in technology companies that solve fundamental industry problems. Starting with manufacturing through [RealOptix](https://github.com/RealOptix), we're expanding into new sectors where technology can drive meaningful change.



## ðŸ“Œ Why It Matters
We look for industries where outdated approaches create massive inefficiencies. Take manufacturing: through [RealOptix](https://github.com/RealOptix), we're tackling the **$1.5 Trillions USD** lost yearly to unexpected factory downtime. This focus on high-impact problems guides our expansion into additional sectors where technology can transform how industries work.


## How We Work
### We believe in:
1. Finding real problems worth solving
2. Testing solutions thoroughly before scaling them
3. Working with experts who understand each industry
4. Making sure our solutions help both business and society


## ðŸŽ¯ What Makes Us Different
- We don't just invest money - **we build solutions**
- Every company we build has to prove its **real-world impact**
- We share technology and insights **across our companies**
- We focus on **long-term** positive change, not quick exits
